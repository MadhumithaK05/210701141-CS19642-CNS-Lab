# Diffie Hellman Algorithm
## AIM:
To write a  program to implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange technique.
## ALGORITHM:
1. Get a prime number q as input from the user.
2. Get a value xa and xb which is less than q.
3. Calculate primitive root α
4. For each user A, generate a key Xa &lt; q
5. Compute public key, α pow (Xa) mod q 6. Each user computes Ya
7. Print the values of exchanged keys.
