# RAIL-FENCE  CIPHER
## AIM:
To implement Rail-Fence Cipher technique using any programming Language.
## ALGORITHM:
1. Get the plaintext string from the user.
2. Take the string length of the plaintext.
3. For each plaintext character do the following-
  a. If ch % 2 == 0 put in a[] array
	b. Else put in b[] array
4. Take each character in a[] array and put in s[] array and increment the index.
5. After all characters in a[] array are copied, then copy each character from b[] array and put into s[] array and increment the index.
6. Print the contents of s[] array to get ciphertext.
